Problem 2                                           Concert Tickets

There are three tickets for a concert. The VIP tickets cost $120, premium tickets cost $80, and regular tickets cost $40. Prompt the user how many tickets of each category he would like. Then print an invoice with overview of the order and total price. Include a sales tax of 9.25%.

How many tickets would you like to order? VIP Tickets ($120): <strong>0</strong>

Premium Tickets ($80): <strong>4</strong>

Regular Tickets ($40): <strong>2</strong>

Invoice:

VIP:        $120 x 0 = $  0.00

Premium:  $ 80 X 4 = $320.00

Regular:  $ 40 x 2 = $ 80.00

Sales Tax:    9.25% = $ 37.00 —————————— Total Price:           $437.00

Problem 3                               Program a Calculator

Write a program that can be used as a calculator. Prompt the user to enter which operation he/she would like to perform, that is addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. Use a switch statements to properly handle the operator entered by the user. Then prompt the user to enter two operands. An example of the program may look like this:

Calculator

——————-

What operation would you like to perform?

Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), or Division (/)

Enter an operator: <strong>+</strong>

Enter operand 1: <strong>23 </strong>

Enter operand 2: <strong>45</strong>

The results is: 23 + 45 = 78Problem 4                               Months

Write a program that determines the season based on the month. The program prompts a user to enter a month (1-12) and then prints if that month is in spring, summer fall or winter. The program must also check if a valid month was entered. For simplicity, assume: 1-3: spring, 4-6: summer, 7-9 fall, 10-12 winter.

Enter a month (1-12): <strong>-5</strong>                  Enter a month (1-12): <strong>7</strong> That is not a valid month!            The 7. month is in fall!

OR                                                                               OR




Enter a month (1-12): <strong>3</strong>                 Enter a month (1-12): <strong>14</strong>

The 3. month is in spring!             That month must be in the future.
